      My name is Taylor Wu. I started programming in May 2016. I learned how to program at a coding boot camp. 
      After graduating the course, I have found a new passion in web development. Currently, I am a student at 
      the University of Utah and I will graduate with a BS in Information Systems in Spring of 2017. During my 
      free time I love to play video games. During the winter I love to go snowboarding. This will be a blog 
      about new technologies that I am learning about. In addtion I will add posts about myself and my life!
