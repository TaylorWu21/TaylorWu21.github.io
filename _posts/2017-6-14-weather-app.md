<h4>Today I saw a cool new library! <a href='https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction'>Semantic UI React</a> was a kick ass library that I wanted to try using! I decided that I wanted to create a simple weather app that I can use. I was sick and tired of using others people weather app with bloated information that I didn't need</h4>


<h4>Another library that I used was <a href='https://webpack.js.org/'>webpack 2</a>. I built my webpack.config from scratch! Webpack is a powerful tool javascript developers can use to bundle up all their js into one file.

<h4>So here whats the semantic UI React looks like</h4>

<h4>The icons aren't showing up in here, so heres a link to the surge website where I deployed it to</h4>
