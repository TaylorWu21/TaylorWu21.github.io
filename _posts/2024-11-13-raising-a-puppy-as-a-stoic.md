# Raising a Puppy as a Stoic

I recently got my dog Millie. I got her at 8 weeks old and knew that I needed to be diligent while training her. I was thinking about the person I want to be while raising her and thought about the teachings of Stoicism and how I can apply its teaching when raising a new puppy. a couple of concepts come to mind

## Strict With Myself and Tolerant of Millie

I recently read this quote from Meditations:

> If they've made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you can't do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one. - Marcus Aurelius Book 10 Quote 4
> What an absolute great quote to remember when raising a puppy. I have the power to shape this dog to be the best companion and if they make a mistake that is on me to fix. Millie is a product of me and how I train and take care of her. Remember to always be consistent and do not punish her for making mistakes.

The time and work put into her will be returned 10 fold. All that discipline will pay off in giving you freedom. Freedom of not worrying about her having an accident. Of her not listening to your commands when you need her to behave. She will be well trained, so others can look after her if I need to go on vacation.

## Focus On What I Control

When raising her focus on what I control. I control the environment she's in, when she goes out, when she eats and her training. There are more things I can control, but it is up to me to make sure that she is happy and healthy. I must be mindful of my reactions of her accidents or her chewing on things that she isn't suppose to. I can help regulate her mood, by taking her on walks, or doing training. I need to keep her healthy and moving. I need to make sure she goes to the vet when needed and have her check ups. I need to keep her groomed and clean for myself, because I hate a dirty home.

## Memento Mori (Remember Death)

I remember the fact that my time and Millie's time is limited on this earth. Her lifespan is around 15 years and I need to remember that I don't have that much time with her. Remember that one of us will die before the other and to cherish the time that we have together. Having her as a puppy is hard now, because of all the work I need to do, but I shouldn't forget the puppy phase will be short and I will miss her puppy phase when she is older.

Being mindful when I am with her. Taking the time to notice how she is feeling or noticing changes in her health. She always gives you her full attention when you're with her, so I need to do the same for her. Remember to not be distracted with the non-essential in life. She has me as her number one priority, so make sure that she gets the attention she needs.

Feel grateful to have her as a companion, because she will make my life so much better. She will take care of me just as much as I take care of her. She does not care how much money I make, or what I own, she loves me for me and that's all I can ask for.

> A person can learn a lot from a dog, even a loopy one like ours. Marley taught me about living each day with unbridled exuberance and joy, about seizing the moment and following your heart. He taught me to appreciate the simple things-a walk in the woods, a fresh snowfall, a nap in a shaft of winter sunlight. And as he grew old and achy, he taught me about optimism in the face of adversity. Mostly, he taught me about friendship and selflessness and, above all else, unwavering loyalty - Marley and Me
