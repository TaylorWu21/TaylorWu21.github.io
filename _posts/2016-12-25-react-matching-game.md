  For Christmas I, decided to create a game for my friends. Its a matching game where the 
  player can choose their friends from a select menu. After they finish it will shuffle 
  all the friends they choose to play with into an array and display the card to match.

<ul>
  <li>Building the logic to shuffle the card to be put into an array</li>
  <li>Making sure the user can't cheat by double clicking the same card</li>
</ul>
