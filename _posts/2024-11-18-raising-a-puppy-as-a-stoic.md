# Raising a Puppy as a Stoic

I recently welcomed Millie, an 8-week-old puppy, into my life. From the start, I knew that raising her would require patience, consistency, and self-reflection. This journey led me to consider the teachings of Stoicism—an ancient philosophy that emphasizes self-discipline, mindfulness, and acceptance. Here are a few ways I've applied Stoic principles to raising Millie.

## Strict with Myself, Tolerant with Millie

I recently read this quote from Meditations:

> If they've made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you can't do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one. - Marcus Aurelius, Book 10, Quote 4

What an absolutely great quote to remember when raising a puppy. I have the power to shape this dog into the best companion, and if she makes a mistake, it is on me to fix it. Millie is a product of how I train and take care of her. I need to always be consistent and avoid punishing her for making mistakes.

The time and effort I put into her will be returned tenfold. All that discipline will pay off by giving me freedom—freedom from worrying about her having an accident, not listening to commands when I need her to behave, or struggling to leave her with others when I go on vacation. A well-trained dog is a joy to live with and care for.

## Focus on What I Control

While patience and understanding are essential when addressing Millie's mistakes, the next step is to turn inward and reflect on what I can actively control to create an environment where she can thrive. I control the environment she's in: when she goes out, when she eats, and how she’s trained. There are many aspects within my control, but it’s my responsibility to ensure that she is happy and healthy.

I must also be mindful of how I react to her accidents or her chewing on things she isn’t supposed to. I can regulate her mood by taking her on walks or conducting training sessions. I need to keep her healthy and active, make sure she goes to the vet for regular checkups, and keep her groomed and clean. A tidy home is important to me, and grooming her helps me maintain that.

## Memento Mori: Cherishing Time with Millie

I remind myself that both Millie’s time and mine on this earth are limited. Her lifespan is about 15 years, and I need to cherish the time we have together. One of us will outlive the other, and it’s important to make the most of every moment. Raising her as a puppy is challenging now because of the effort required, but this phase will be short, and one day I’ll miss it.

Being mindful when I’m with her means noticing how she’s feeling or recognizing changes in her health. She always gives me her full attention when we’re together, so I need to do the same for her. I must avoid distractions from nonessential things and prioritize our time together.

I feel grateful to have her as a companion because she enriches my life in countless ways. She cares for me as much as I care for her. She doesn’t judge me by how much money I make or what I own—she simply loves me for who I am, and that’s all I could ever ask for.

## Conclusion

Raising Millie has been a transformative experience, teaching me lessons not only about her but also about myself. Stoicism reminds me to stay present, patient, and purposeful in my actions. As she grows, I look forward to continuing this journey of mutual growth, gratitude, and joy.

> A person can learn a lot from a dog, even a loopy one like ours. Marley taught me about living each day with unbridled exuberance and joy, about seizing the moment and following your heart. He taught me to appreciate the simple things—a walk in the woods, a fresh snowfall, a nap in a shaft of winter sunlight. And as he grew old and achy, he taught me about optimism in the face of adversity. Mostly, he taught me about friendship and selflessness and, above all else, unwavering loyalty. - Marley and Me
