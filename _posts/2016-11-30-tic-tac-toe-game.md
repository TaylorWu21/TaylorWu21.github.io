<p>
  Facebook updated their react documentation and they have a great tutorial on building a tic tac toe game!
  I used their create-react-app npm package to start building the tic tac toe game.

<p>If you want to use facebooks create-react-app package you need to have node installed</p>
<p>After that you need to run this command in the terminal</p>

{% highlight HTML %}
  npm install create-react-app -g
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will install create-react-app globally, so you can use it anywhere</p>
<p>Now run create-react-app plus whatever you want to name the app in the terminal</p>

{% highlight HTML %}
  create-react-app tic-tac-toe
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now you can start developing react apps without worrying about the boilerplates needed to start a react application</p>

<p>Instead of using 'x' and 'o' I used my friends as the two in gif form!</p>
