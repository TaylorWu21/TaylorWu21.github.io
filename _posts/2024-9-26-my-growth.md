# The end of my old life

This year has been quite the journey. Just at the end of last year, I broke up with my long time girlfriend of 9 years. November 13th, 2023 will always be one of the hardest day of my life. I had to face reality, the family and life I've built with her was coming to an end and I was going to lose her and the dog we had together. We tried our best to make it work, but no matter what we did, one fact remained. We wanted different things in life. I was ready to settle down and start a family and she wasn't ready. She wanted to travel the world and see new things and be free to do the things she's always dreamed of. Neither of us were wrong in pursuing these things, but we could not hold each other back from each others dreams.

Personally I've went through all the stages of grief this year. It has been eye opening how there can still be so much love and yet it still can't work out. I'm proud of myself and the resolve I have for wanting a future family even at the cost of the current one I had. Although I don't want to say our relationship was perfect, there were lots of issues we needed to work through. Our communication was not the best, and towards the end of the relationship we lost that friendship that is so important in a romantic relationship. I heard a quote this year that stuck with me, "No one leaves a good relationship". The fact that the both of us were ready to call it quits meant that maybe we both felt that this relationship has ran its course. I will always be grateful to Britt, she has shown me the importance of loving another person unconditionally, to love animals, and being kind to others.

I remember telling her while we were still together that 2023 was the best year ever so far. We've traveled the world and saw Europe and Japan together. We've went and done so many things together. And looking back now in late 2024. It's definitely been a hard year, but hard times also mean a chance at growing as a person. This year has overshadowed 2023 as the best year, because its been a year full of failure and triumph. I have grown so much as a person this year that I am proud of the person I am becoming.

# The Struggle within me

Back in July 26, 2020, I had a journey entry that I read recently. The summary was that I was unhappy with the way I lived my life. The pandemic kept me inside, I was not focused on my job and only cared about the money I was making. I was not working out and was getting out of shape and getting skinnier. I was addicted to social media (reddit) and video games. I was distracted in life and was just living aimlessly without any purpose or goal. Fast forward to 2023 and its almost the same story. The only difference was that the pandemic was over and I was able to go out and travel the world. I had fallen into the hedonic treadmill of life and was trying to get my happiness from easy pleasure. My weekends would consist of me waking up late and scrolling on my phone for hours before waking up to smoke weed and play videos games. I would get lazy to go out and order food in and not leave the house. I had fallen into the trap of convenience of modern life. These traits were not traits of a good father. How could I want a family if I was lazy, unmotivated, and undisciplined. My work has been giving me raises and I had lost myself in the money. Everything became easier because I relied on the money. I was eating out every day. I could afford to go on lots of vacation. I used money as a way to buy convenience and it damaged my character. By the time of our break up, I felt that I was already unhappy with myself and did not put in the work to change myself. I have always been a non-empathic person and it has always been something I knew I needed to change. When the break up happened I fell into a deep depression with suicidal thoughts. This event had made me realized how much work I needed do for myself and how I was not happy with the person I was.

# The Work on myself

I started working out after the break up in November as a way to cope with the stress and depression. I quit social media and delete my reddit account. I quit video games because I knew that I needed spend more time working on myself. With the goal of becoming a more empathetic person. After realizing that I needed help, the beginning of this year in January I started therapy. My therapist helped me with processing my thoughts and feelings and gave me tools and practices I can do to be a more empathetic person. I started opening up my feelings more with the people around. I gained more meaningful relationships this way. People connected with me deeply through struggles I've had, because they experienced it too and we understood each other better. I started becoming more aware of my negative thoughts and journaled to help process those feelings. With therapy I mended my relationship with my mom. I had always held my mom with contempt, because I saw traits I hated in myself that I saw in my mother. This always made me unfairly angry with her and always assumed the worst intention from her. During a therapy session I've realized that I was projecting the hate I have towards myself to my mom. I've since had a conversation with my mother about why I felt the way that I did. I've realized now how loving and kind my mother is and we've been close ever since.

# The Discovery of Self-help books and philosophy

I started reading books and listening to podcasts. After reading around 30 of them, I had narrowed the 3 most impactful books I've read this year. The 3 book that had the most impact on me is "Atomic Habits", by James Clear, "Meditations', by Marcus Aurelius, and "Heart of Buddha's Teaching', by Thich Nhat Hanh. I want to share some of my learnings from these books and practices that shaped who I am today.

## Atomic habits

This book taught me the importance of having an identity of the person I want to be. Once I know who I want to be I can start working towards becoming that person. I know I want to be a good father and the traits of a great father to me is resilience, hard working, kind, strong, and empathetic. Some of my favorite lessons I've learn from this book are:

- If you improve by 1% each day for a year, you'll be 37 times better by the end of the year.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
- Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
- In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

# Meditations and the Discovery of Stoic Philosophy

I remembered my first lesson of Stoic philosophy from my cousin Will. Back when I was 21 and in Vegas. Our hotel room was robbed and we lost thousands of dollars of our possessions. I remember him telling me that we have control on our own feelings and actions and its not what happens to us that matters, its how we react to what happens to us that matters, It has always stuck with me since then. This year I discovered Ryan Holiday's books on Stoic Philosophy and learned about one of the greatest emperor who's ever lived, Marcus Aurelius. I have learned so much about how to become a stronger, calmer, and wiser person from practicing Stoic philosophy. Some of the most important things I've learned from practicing Stoic philosophy:

- It's not things that upset us, its our opinion about things.
- It's not that life is short, its that we waste so much time on the non-essential.
- Amor fati. Love one's fate. Embrace the challenges that I get to face, because its only going to make me a stronger person because of it.
- Focus on what I can control.
- Don't just think about what a good man is, be one.
- Death is happening to me right now. Do the essential and discard everything else.

# Buddhist Philosophy

Reading and practicing Buddhist philosophy helped me not fall into the pitfalls of modern life. To not spend all my time on the internet, to self reflect and meditate on the present. This has helped me be more mindful and present in my everyday life. I've been taking daily walks and started to spend more time in nature. Being more present has helped me feel more alive than ever.

- Do not lose yourself in the past. Do not lose yourself in the future. Do not get caught in your anger, worries, or fears. Come back to the present moment, and touch life deeply. This is mindfulness.
- Mindfulness puts an end to such a limited perspective. The Buddha faced his own suffering directly and discovered the path of liberation. Don’t run away from things that are unpleasant in order to embrace things that are pleasant. Put your hands in the earth. Face the difficulties and grow new happiness.
- Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free.
- All beings are interconnected, and our happiness is linked to the well-being of others

# The person I am now

I am a person who tries his best at everything I do. I try my best to be mindful of my actions and thoughts. Someone who is physically active and takes care of his body. I know I am not perfect and will sometimes fail at the things I try, but I know that I will improve by failing. As I learn to be more confident in myself, I hope to inspire and influence others around to be the best they can be. In return they will inspire me to be better. I know that I have a lot of work to do on myself and every day I have the chance to be a better version of myself. I am grateful for this life that has been granted to me and I will make the most of it. I will die someday and I want to live my life the way I want it to be. Surrounded by loved ones and people who make me happy.
